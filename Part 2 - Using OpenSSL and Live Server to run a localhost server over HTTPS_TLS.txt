Part 2: Using OpenSSL and Live Server to run a localhost server over HTTPS/TLS
Part 2
In this part you'll discover how to create a localhost server that runs over HTTPS and TLS using OpenSSL with Live Server.

Here's what you'll learn:

Create a Certificate Authority (CA): To run an HTTPS server, you need an entity to sign your server's certificate. We'll create a CA using OpenSSL directly.

Generate Certificates: next, you'll learn how to create a CSR certificate for localhost using OpenSSL, which your CA can then sign.

Configure OpenSSL: I'll show you how to set up a config.cnf file so that you can customize your CSR file and specify your common name, domains, etc.

Access Your Site: you know the drill. The final step is to visit https://localhost:4430 in your browser to test whether you can access your site.
