Summary of the hybrid key exchange mechanism in TLS 1.3
This is all I would like you to gain from the previous lecture: 

Hybrid key exchange uses both classical algorithms (e.g., ECDH) and post-quantum algorithms (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium) to enhance security.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed advanced crypto techniques, such as key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), to enhance security against quantum threats.
